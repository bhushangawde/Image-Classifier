# Image-Classifier

This project is based on Deep Learning. In this project, I built a convolutional neural network using Python programming language and Tensorflow framework. This network was trained for the task of image recognition. CIFAR10 dataset was used for training and testing. The network achieved a test accuracy of 73%.
